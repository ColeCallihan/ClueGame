Cole Callihan and Carter Pasqualini

For our 4 tests, we decided to test the four doorways that open our lounge area. 
This room has at least one doorway that opens to each direction, making it a simple way to check all 4 directions while staying located in the same general area.

For the last test, we are testing the first cell in our first 3 rooms, and the last cell in the next 2 rooms.
We included a walkway in between these rooms, and then the closet in the bottom right to make sure it is not a room.
